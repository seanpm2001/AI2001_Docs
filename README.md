## FAQ

**Q**: Will this AI replace me?

**A:** This AI is aimed to help task the human and be a tool, not replace them. Measures will be taken to prevent a "humans need not apply" scenario, think more in lines of Transhumanism than in human replacement.

**Q:** Was this project created to spite Google?

A: No it wasn't. I have had an interest in Artificial Intelligence since at least 2021, and after learning of ChatGPT, I wanted to create an open source solution. This project started being planned over a month before Google created Bard, which was a product of spite. If anything, this project is likely an in-house project, and is definitely not clean room design, as I didn't have any notable reference to build from. It does not take inspiration from Bard, but may take some from ChatGPT

**Q:** Are you worried about SkyNet?

**A:** It is a cautionary tale to be aware of, moral and ethical decisions will be made to prevent the AI from being too powerful.

**Q:** Autonomous weapons/killer robots?

**A:** I am strongly against Autonomous weapons (also known as Killer Robots) military use of this AI is forbidden, and further decisions will be made to weaken military use. Also yes, I am aware of SlaughterBots
