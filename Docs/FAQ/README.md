## FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

**Q**: Will this AI replace me?

**A:** This AI is aimed to help task the human and be a tool, not replace them. Measures will be taken to prevent a "humans need not apply" scenario, think more in lines of Transhumanism than in human replacement.

**Q:** Was this project created to spite Google?

A: No it wasn't. I have had an interest in Artificial Intelligence since at least 2021, and after learning of ChatGPT, I wanted to create an open source solution. This project started being planned over a month before Google created Bard, which was a product of spite. If anything, this project is likely an in-house project, and is definitely not clean room design, as I didn't have any notable reference to build from. It does not take inspiration from Bard, but may take some from ChatGPT

Also, software should never be created purely out of spite. This will lead to the software failing and becoming overlooked in the future.

**Q:** Are you worried about SkyNet?

**A:** It is a cautionary tale to be aware of, moral and ethical decisions will be made to prevent the AI from being too powerful.

**Q:** Autonomous weapons/killer robots?

**A:** I am strongly against Autonomous weapons (also known as Killer Robots) military use of this AI is forbidden, and further decisions will be made to weaken military use. Also yes, I am aware of SlaughterBots
