# ClosedAI

OpenAI has a misleading name now. Since the release of GPT-4, all current software by OpenAI is no longer open, it is closed (closed source) thus I feel OpenAI should rename to ClosedAI, until they can make everything open source again (if they ever do)

Having closed source Artificial Intelligence is extremely dangerous and unethical, and is a double standard when they complain about the dangers of Artificial Intelligence, since hiding what you are doing is only making the problem worse.
