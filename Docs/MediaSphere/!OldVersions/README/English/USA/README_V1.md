# [The MediaSphere](/MediaSphere1.png)

The MediaSphere is the template logo for AI2001. It represents diversity, beauty, and complexity in data.

This is the template logo that is used in places where the official logo isn't used. Since there is no other logo right now, this is the de facto logo of the project.

An SVG version is not yet available.
