Cartography datasets are used for maps of the planet Earth, and other planets, space regions and objects. They are reliant on open source map technologies, such as [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).

As of 2023, Monday, January 15th, there are `6/7` cartography datasets, with many more planned in the coming months/years. They include:

The map explorer is just a section for making a map of all map datasets. The dataset collection is heavily future-proofed, but currently has many flaws in this proofing (such as the milky way not being a lower level dataset) also, sovereign countries (such as Tibet, Russia, and China) are not included in this way, instead, the datasets are named after the geographical regions, rather than political divisions. This means terms like "roof of the world" "altai mountains" and "pearl river delta" are used instead.

This is a very long term goal that will require a lot of community work. The current documented maps include:
