R is the default language for writing AI2001. It is used due to its prominence in data mining, data analytics, and statistics. It is also used for software diversity reasons. 7 other languages are also used:

- [C](/Docs/Programming/Language-Usage/C/)
- [Cython](/Docs/Programming/Language-Usage/Cython/)
- [Julia](/Docs/Programming/Language-Usage/Julia/)
- [Markdown](/Docs/Programming/Language-Usage/Markdown/)
- [Prolog](/Docs/Programming/Language-Usage/Prolog/)
- [Python](/Docs/Programming/Language-Usage/Python/)
- [RMarkdown](/Docs/Programming/Language-Usage/RMarkdown/)

R is currently used on every AI2001 project and repository, except for the documentation repository (as of 2023, Tuesday, March 21st)
