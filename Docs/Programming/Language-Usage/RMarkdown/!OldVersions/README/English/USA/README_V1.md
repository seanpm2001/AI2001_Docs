RMarkdown is the secondary language for writing AI2001. It is used due to its relations with R, as a documentation language. 7 other languages are also used:

- [C](/Docs/Programming/Language-Usage/C/)
- [Cython](/Docs/Programming/Language-Usage/Cython/)
- [Julia](/Docs/Programming/Language-Usage/Julia/)
- [Markdown](/Docs/Programming/Language-Usage/Markdown/)
- [Prolog](/Docs/Programming/Language-Usage/Prolog/)
- [Python](/Docs/Programming/Language-Usage/Python/)
- [R](/Docs/Programming/Language-Usage/R/)

RMarkdown is currently used on every AI2001 project and repository, except for the documentation and homepage repositories (as of 2023, Tuesday, March 21st)
